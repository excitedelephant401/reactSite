# Development

### Link to Deployed Website
If you used the stencil code, this is `https://<your GitHub username>.github.io/<name of your repository>`

### Goal and Value of the Application
The goal of this application is to display the catalog of a toy store. Specifically, the goal is to display this catalog in a digestible manner so users can navigate it and choose and buy items. The value this application has is that it allows users to easily search through a toy store's big catalog to find an item they need or want to purchase.

### Usability Principles Considered
The primary usability principles considered in this application come from the organization of it. I put the filters and sort at the top of the screen. This was to allow for easy navigation so users could have access to the different filtering options. This is an important functionality because users want to be able to easily narrow down the catalog to meet their interests. Additionally, the sort allows users to organize the catalog by price which is important for users in deciding what items to buy. Finally, the cart is also placed prominently on the website. This is because this is a major aspect of the goal as it allows users to consolidate what they want to buy it later. Furthermore, all of the information associated with a product were added to a section specifically designated for the product.

### Organization of Components
The three major components of the app are the App.js file, Item.js, and Aggregator.js. The App.js contains all of the state variables and information for the whole page. Within App.js, the data of the catalog is mapped to each be represented as an Item.js component. Finally, the Aggregator.js component stores the information associated with the cart on the website.
